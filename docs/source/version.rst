=======
**1.0.0a1  First public release (alpha, v1)**
    This first release offers read-only capabilities to the Unsplash REST API.
    Although with this limitation, I thought it would be useful to start exposing
    the library and collect feedback from the community early on.

    Features that are right now on my TODO list:

    - Authorization workflow & Current user
    - Write operations

    Desired:
    - More unit-test coverage
    - Documentation review
