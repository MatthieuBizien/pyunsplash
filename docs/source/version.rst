**PyUnsplash v1.0.0rc1 (release candidate, v1)**

    This is the first release candidate for production ready 1.0.0 of PyUnsplash.
    Thanks to all the early adopters, there have been a number of improvements and
    bugfixes and now should be a good time to start the rc process.

    This release brings one useful addition:

    - Introduction of SinglePhoto which allows instantiating a Photo object using a photo_id
    - Deprecated `format` value 'str' in favor of 'txt' in `get_attribution()`

    **Todo**
    - Authorization workflow & Current user
    - Write operations
